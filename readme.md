# zelpst /zɛlpst/

[zɛlpst](http://zelpst.de) is at the time of writing the personal 
blog of Philipp Geisler. The code is based on a clone of
[getkirby/plainkit](https://github.com/getkirby/plainkit) which
again is the minimal edition of [Kirby](http://getkirby.com) by
[Christian Allgeier](https://github.com/bastianallgeier) (
[ibid.](http://getkirby.com)).

This repository contains adjustments to only the most
basic publicly viewable content like e.g. 
page headers/titles of individual pages
as they are part of the Kirby templates.

The actual blog content can be found in a separate
repository on GitHub, [zelpst-content](https://github.com/philippgeisler/zelpst-content).

It does contain all changes to layout, basically the theme,
and a couple of additional features like e.g. forwarding of
short URLs.

## Contributing

As the entire layout is a concoction of my own, I will be
thankful for any suggestions on how to improve my code,
especially of what is my personal (mis)understanding of CSS.

## Usage

My personal changes, mainly the files making up my site layout,
are free to clone/use/share as long as you keep a reference 
to this repository and the original author, Philipp Geisler.
A link back to http://zelpst.de would be appreciated.

*Everything else is subject to the terms of use/licensing for
the original Kirby CMS. The original README including licensing
information is included below.*

# Kirby

Kirby is a file-based CMS.
Easy to setup. Easy to use. Flexible as hell.

## Trial

You can try Kirby on your local machine or on a test
server as long as you need to make sure it is the right
tool for your next project.

## Buy a license

You can purchase your Kirby license at
<http://getkirby.com/buy>

A Kirby license is valid for a single domain. You can find 
Kirby's license agreement here: <http://getkirby.com/license>

## The Plainkit

Kirby's Plainkit is the most minimal setup you can get started with.
It does not include any content, styles or other kinds of decoration, 
so it's perfect to use this as a starting point for your own project.

## The Panel

You can find the login for Kirby's admin interface at
http://yourdomain.com/panel. You will be guided through the signup
process for your first user, when you visit the panel
for the first time.

## Installation

Kirby does not require a database, which makes it very easy to
install. Just copy Kirby's files to your server and visit the
URL for your website in the browser.

**Please check if the invisible .htaccess file has been
copied to your server correctly**

### Requirements

Kirby runs on PHP 5.3+, Apache or Nginx.

### Download

You can download the latest version of the Starterkit
from http://download.getkirby.com

### With Git

If you are familiar with Git, you can clone Kirby's
Starterkit repository from Github.

    git clone --recursive https://github.com/getkirby/plainkit.git
